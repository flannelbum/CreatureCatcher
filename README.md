# CreatureCatcher

### CreatureCatcher is yet another mob catcher plugin for spigot 1.12+  
Currently still in testing - please report any issues.

In-game, use **/getcreaturecatcher** to spawn in, for now, an enchanted wooden hoe.  This CreatureCatcher can then be used to capture and place a mob by right-clicking.
